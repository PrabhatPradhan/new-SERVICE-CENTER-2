                A kitchen chimney plays a vital role in removing smoke, grease, and odors from your cooking area. But with so many models in the market, it can be overwhelming to choose the right one.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">1. Understand Suction Power</h2>
              <p>
                The suction power of a chimney determines how efficiently it can pull in smoke and oil particles. For Indian kitchens, a suction power of 1000 mÂ³/hr or higher is usually recommended.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">2. Choose the Right Filter Type</h2>
              <p>
                Chimneys come with three types of filters: cassette, baffle, and charcoal. Baffle filters are ideal for Indian cooking due to their better oil separation capability and easier cleaning.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">3. Consider Your Kitchen Size</h2>
              <p>
                Match the chimney size to your kitchen size and stove width. A 60 cm chimney is suitable for 2-burner stoves, while 90 cm works best for 3-4 burner setups.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">4. Ducted vs. Ductless</h2>
              <p>
                Ducted chimneys are more effective in venting out smoke, whereas ductless ones are easier to install but require frequent filter changes.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">5. Look for Smart Features</h2>
              <p>
                Auto-clean, touch controls, and motion sensing are features that make chimneys more user-friendly and easier to maintain.
              </p>

              <p className="font-semibold">
                Final Tip: Always check user reviews and brand warranty when making a purchase. A well-chosen chimney can greatly improve your kitchen experience.
